The matrix below endeavors to provide guidance as to the factors one should consider when looking towards on-premises or cloud deployments. Like everything else in IT, there are trade-offs, what is right for one organization may be totally inappropriate for another.

By prioritizing and then determining the type of technical and economic resources your organization is willing devote to each of the areas below, you’ll be able to make a better and more informed decision.

|||Cost|
|---|---|---|
|<nobr>On-Premises</nobr>|Advantage| Can be cheaper in the long run |
||Disadvantage| Significant upfront hardware and software costs (cap-ex) means a mistake can be hugely expensive |
|Cloud|Advantage| Predictable subscription pricing <br> Costs allocated to op-ex <br>No upfront hardware/software cost|
||Disadvantage|Really need to project costs out over the long-term<br> Software licensing can mitigate hardware savings|

|||Security|
|---|---|---|
|<nobr>On-Premises</nobr>|Advantage|Organization in full control of the data locally<br>No third-party access to the data 
||Disadvantage|Requires dedicated and knowledgeable resources <br>If organization lacks appropriate expertise, it risks significant exposure 
|Cloud|Advantage|Deliver superior data security
||Disadvantage| Aggressively targeted by hackers <br>Data could be accessed by 3rd party.

|||Agility and Scalability|
|---|---|---|
|<nobr>On-Premises</nobr>|Advantage|Physical control over the hardware means upgrades can be tightly controlled
||Disadvantage| Need to plan well in advance to changes in demand because of the time necessary to research, justify, order, and deploy hardware. <br> Could be stuck with excess IT infrastructure which may or may not be able to be re-purposed
|Cloud|Advantage| Cloud resources can be rapidly adjusted to accommodate specific demand
||Disadvantage| Costs escalate when the cloud infrastructure is improperly managed and not properly tracked 

|||Resiliency|
|---|---|---|
|<nobr>On-Premises</nobr>|Advantage| Build out only the level of redundancy needed.<br>  Especially cost effective when 99.999% uptime isn't a concern
||Disadvantage| Costly to properly build out when 99.999% is required
|Cloud|Advantage| Much easier and in most cases more cost effective when building out multi-site/ geo-redundant server and storage
||Disadvantage| Outside your control - you’re at the cloud providers mercy

|||Software Customization|
|---|---|---|
|<nobr>On-Premises</nobr>|Advantage|Readily able to customize the platform to meet unique requirements.
||Disadvantage|Customizations can lead to reliability and software support issues
|Cloud|Advantage| SaaS platforms are quite stable. Updates are iterative
||Disadvantage|SaaS minimize the ability to modify the platform

|||Software Deployment|
|---|---|---|
|<nobr>On-Premises</nobr>|Advantage| Technology can be deployed based on unique IT infrastructure and application requirements
||Disadvantage| Complexity can mean lengthy and difficult deployments
|Cloud|Advantage| SaaS is quick to implement
||Disadvantage| SaaS is implemented to a lowest common denominator, limiting functionality

|||IT Support|
|---|---|---|
|<nobr>On-Premises</nobr>|Advantage| Infrastructure and application expertise are readily available
||Disadvantage| Dedicated IT necessary, especially when applications are tailored to meet an organization’s unique requirements.
|Cloud|Advantage|The economies of scale inherent to cloud deployments mean that IT support can manage more with less time and effort
||Disadvantage| The learning curve for cloud is significant.<br> Properly trained personnel are expensive
